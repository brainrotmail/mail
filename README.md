## Description:

Generates email accounts using a self-hosted email server, signs up for a website, and completes the verification process.

## Purpose of the program:

Giveaway websites typically require contestants to follow the person or company hosting the giveaway on social media, like their posts, or sign up for their promotional newsletter. Some also award additional entries for every friend you refer.
If we can create thousands of accounts that complete the email verification, then we can significantly increase our chances of winning.

## To do list:

- buy domain

- set up email server

- make a python script that interfaces with the email server

- I don't know the exact specifics yet, so idk, we'll figure it out :3
