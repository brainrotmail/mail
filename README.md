# BrainrotMail

## Description:

Generates email accounts using a self-hosted email server, signs up for a website, and completes the verification process.

## Purpose of the program:

Giveaway websites typically require contestants to follow the person or company hosting the giveaway on social media, like their posts, or sign up for their promotional newsletter. Some also award additional entries for every friend you refer.
If we can create thousands of accounts that complete the email verification, then we can significantly increase our chances of winning.

## To do list:

[x] buy domain

[ ] set up a self hosted email server

[ ] make a script that generates emails on our email server 

[ ] make the script also read emails from different inboxes

[ ] make the script run the desired (verification) link that it detects in the inbox
